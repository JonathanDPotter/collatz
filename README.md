# Collatz

This is my implementation of a recursive function to find the number of iterations it takes to reduce a number to 1 using the Collatz sequence.

---

## Functionality

The user enters a number and submits the form. The number of iterations is calculated and the result is displayed on the screen.

---

## Technologies used

This is a very simple implementation of HTML CSS and JavaScript. I did use CSS custom properties to make it easy to change the color palette that I used.
